### **Tip 3: Select All Shortcut**
Click the "Select All" checkbox in the header to select all visible bookings at once.

### **Tip 4: Assignment Order**
For best workflow:
1. Import bookings (no advisors)
2. Let them settle in database
3. Then bulk assign/auto-assign
4. Better control and visibility

### **Tip 5: Unassign & Reassign**
If assignment isn't right:
1. Unassign the bookings
