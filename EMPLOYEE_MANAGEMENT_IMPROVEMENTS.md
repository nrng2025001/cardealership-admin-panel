## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Delete button is grayed out/disabled"

**Hover over the button** to see the reason:

1. **"Cannot delete yourself"**
   - Solution: Ask another admin to delete your account if needed

2. **"No permission to delete employees"**
   - Solution: You need ADMIN, GENERAL_MANAGER, or SALES_MANAGER role

3. **Button not grayed but nothing happens**
   - Check browser console (F12 → Console) for errors
   - Check if backend API is running
   - Verify you're logged in with the correct admin account

### "Failed to delete employee" error

This could mean:
- Backend API returned an error
- Employee has dependent data (check console for details)
- Network connection issue
- Backend doesn't recognize your user (401 error)

**Check the browser console** (F12 → Console tab) for detailed error logs starting with:
- `🗑️ [EMPLOYEES] Deleting employee:`
- `✅ [EMPLOYEES] Employee deleted successfully`
- OR `❌ [EMPLOYEES] Error deleting employee:`
