# üîß Employee Creation Troubleshooting Guide

## The employee creation is failing to save

### Step 1: Check Browser Console

1. Open your browser Developer Tools (Press `F12`)
2. Go to the **Console** tab
3. Try creating an employee

**What to look for:**
```
üíæ [EMPLOYEES] Saving employee: CREATE
Employee data: {...}
Creating new employee...
```

Then either:
- ‚úÖ `‚úÖ [EMPLOYEES] Employee created successfully`
- ‚ùå `‚ùå [EMPLOYEES] Error saving employee`

### Step 2: Identify the Error

#### Error A: 401 Unauthorized

**Symptoms:**
```
‚ùå [EMPLOYEES] Error saving employee
Error details: { status: 401, ... }
‚ö†Ô∏è [API CLIENT] 401 Unauthorized: /auth/users/create-with-credentials
```

**Cause:** You're logged in with a Firebase account that doesn't exist in the backend database.

**Solution:**
1. Log out (click your profile ‚Üí Logout)
2. Log back in with one of these test accounts:
   - Email: `admin.new@test.com`
   - Password: `testpassword123`
   
   OR

### Step 3: Common Issues & Quick Fixes

#### Issue: "Password is required for new employees"

**Fix:** Make sure you filled in the Password field with:
- At least 8 characters
- At least one uppercase letter (A-Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)
- At least one number (0-9)

Example valid passwords:
- `Password123`
- `MyPass456`
- `Employee2024`

#### Issue: Form shows "Failed to save employee" but no details

**Fix:** 
1. Open Browser Console (F12 ‚Üí Console)
2. Look for the detailed error message
3. Copy the error and check which error type it matches above

---

#### Issue: "Request failed with status code 401"

**This is the MOST COMMON issue!**

**Why it happens:**
- You're logged in with a Firebase user that doesn't exist in the backend database
- The backend validates your Firebase token, but can't find you in its database
- So it returns 401 Unauthorized

**How to fix:**

**Option 1: Use Test Accounts (Recommended)**
1. Logout
2. Login with: `admin.new@test.com` / `testpassword123`
3. Try creating employee again

**Option 2: Ask Backend to Add Your User**
Send this to your backend developer:
```
Please add my Firebase user to the database:
- Firebase UID: <your-firebase-uid>
- Email: <your-email>
- Role: ADMIN
```

### Step 4: Test the Fix

After applying the fix:

1. Go to Employees page
2. Click "Add Employee"
3. Fill in the form:
   ```
   Name: Test User
   Email: test@example.com
   Phone: +1234567890
   Role: Advisor
   Department: Sales
   Password: TestPass123
   ```
4. Click "Create Employee"
5. Check if:
   - ‚úÖ Dialog closes
   - ‚úÖ New employee appears in the table
   - ‚úÖ No error message

---

### Step 5: Still Not Working?

1. **Browser Console Log:**
   - Copy everything from the Console tab after trying to create employee

2. **Network Tab:**
   - Open F12 ‚Üí Network tab
   - Try creating employee
   - Find the request to `/auth/users/create-with-credentials`
   - Right-click ‚Üí Copy ‚Üí Copy as cURL
   - Send this to support

   - Which email you're logged in with
