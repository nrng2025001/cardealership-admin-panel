# 🔧 Advisor Assignment Buttons Not Working - Troubleshooting

## 📊 Diagnostic Steps

I've added detailed logging to help us find the issue. Follow these steps:

---

## Step 1: Open Browser Console

1. Open your browser at `http://localhost:5173`
2. Press `F12` to open DevTools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Clear the console (🚫 icon)

---

## Step 2: Try Using the Features

### **Test Bulk Assign Button:**

1. Go to **Bookings** page
2. **Check the boxes** for 2-3 bookings
3. You should see logs like:
   ```
   🔄 [BOOKINGS] Dialog states: {bulkAssignDialogOpen: false, autoAssignDialogOpen: false, selectedCount: 3}
   ```
4. Click **"Assign to Advisor"** button
5. **Look for these logs:**
   ```
   🔘 [BOOKINGS] Opening Bulk Assign Dialog...
   Selected booking IDs: ["booking1", "booking2", "booking3"]
   🔄 [BOOKINGS] Dialog states: {bulkAssignDialogOpen: true, ...}
   🔵 [BULK ASSIGN DIALOG] Props changed: {open: true, bookingIdsCount: 3}
   ✅ [BULK ASSIGN DIALOG] Dialog opened, fetching advisors...
   📊 [BULK ASSIGN] Fetching advisors...
   ```

6. **What happened?**
   - ✅ Dialog opened? → Good, continue testing
   - ❌ Nothing happened? → Share console logs
   - ❌ Error appeared? → Share the error message

---

### **Test Auto-Assign Button:**

1. With bookings still selected, click **"Auto-Assign"** button
2. **Look for these logs:**
   ```
   🔘 [BOOKINGS] Opening Auto-Assign Dialog...
   Selected booking IDs: ["booking1", "booking2", "booking3"]
   🔄 [BOOKINGS] Dialog states: {autoAssignDialogOpen: true, ...}
   🟣 [AUTO ASSIGN DIALOG] Props changed: {open: true, bookingIdsCount: 3}
   ```

---

## Step 3: Common Issues & Solutions

### **Issue 1: No Logs at All**

**Symptoms:** 
- Click button, nothing happens
- No console logs appear

**Possible Causes:**
- JavaScript error preventing code execution
- React not re-rendering

**Solutions:**
1. Check for RED errors in console (before clicking)
2. Refresh the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
3. Clear cache: `http://localhost:5173/?clearCache=true`
4. Check if there are TypeScript errors

---

### **Issue 2: Dialog State Changes But Nothing Shows**

**Symptoms:**
```
🔄 [BOOKINGS] Dialog states: {bulkAssignDialogOpen: true, ...}
```
But no dialog appears on screen

**Possible Causes:**
- Dialog component not rendering
- CSS issue (dialog behind other elements)
- Import error

**Solutions:**
1. Check for import errors in console
2. Look for component errors
3. Try inspecting the DOM (F12 → Elements) and search for "MuiDialog"

---

### **Issue 3: Buttons Don't Appear**

**Symptoms:**
- Selected bookings, but no bulk actions toolbar

**Possible Causes:**
- Permission issue (`canManageBookings()` returns false)
- Selection state not updating

**Debug:**
```
Check console for:
🔄 [BOOKINGS] Dialog states: {selectedCount: 0}
```

If selectedCount stays 0, checkboxes aren't working.

**Solutions:**
1. Verify you're logged in as admin
2. Check `canManageBookings()` permission
3. Try refreshing page

---

### **Issue 4: Import Errors**

**Symptoms:**
```
Failed to import component
Module not found
```

**Possible Causes:**
- File path incorrect
- Component not exported correctly

**Solutions:**
1. Check file exists: `/src/components/bookings/BulkAssignDialog.tsx`
2. Check file exists: `/src/components/bookings/AutoAssignDialog.tsx`
3. Restart dev server

---

## Step 4: What to Share

If it's still not working, please share:

### **From Console Tab:**
```
Copy ALL the logs from console after:
1. Selecting bookings
2. Clicking "Assign to Advisor" button
3. Any errors (red text)
```

### **From Elements Tab:**
```
Press F12 → Elements → Ctrl+F
Search for: "BulkAssignDialog"
Does it exist in the DOM?
```

### **Screenshots:**
- Screenshot of the Bookings page with selected bookings
- Screenshot of browser console

---

## 🔧 Quick Fixes to Try

### **Fix 1: Hard Refresh**
```
Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows/Linux)
Cmd + Shift + R (Mac)
```

### **Fix 2: Clear Cache**
```
Open: http://localhost:5173/?clearCache=true
```

### **Fix 3: Restart Dev Server**

In terminal:
```bash
Ctrl+C (stop server)
npm run dev (restart)
```

### **Fix 4: Check Components Exist**

Run this in terminal:
```bash
ls -la /Users/adityajaif/Desktop/automotiveDashboard/src/components/bookings/
```

Should see:
- BulkAssignDialog.tsx
- AutoAssignDialog.tsx
