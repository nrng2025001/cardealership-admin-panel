# 🔄 Restart Dev Server - Required!

## ✅ Firebase Configured Correctly!

Your `.env` file now has all the proper Firebase credentials.

## ⚠️ Next Step: Restart Dev Server

The Vite dev server was already running when you updated the `.env` file, so it hasn't picked up the new environment variables yet.

### How to Restart:

1. **Go to the terminal running the React Dashboard**
   - Look for the terminal showing `vite` output

2. **Stop the server:**
   ```
   Press: Ctrl + C
   ```

3. **Start it again:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Hard refresh your browser:**
   ```
   Go to: http://localhost:5173
   Press: Cmd + Shift + R (Mac) or Ctrl + Shift + R (Windows)
   ```

## ✅ What Should Happen:

### In Browser Console (F12):
```
✅ Firebase initialized successfully
```

**NOT:**
```
❌ Missing Firebase configuration
```

### Login Page:
```
✅ You can now login with: advisor@test.com / TestPass123!
✅ Or: admin.new@test.com / testpassword123
```

## 📊 Expected Results:

- ✅ No more timeout errors
- ✅ Firebase authentication works
- ✅ Login redirects to dashboard
- ✅ Bookings page loads data
- ✅ All features functional

**Just restart the dev server and you're done!** 🚀
